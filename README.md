# JavaDocs Project – IS247

This project demonstrates how to create JavaDocs in a Java application, how to generate documentation using IntelliJ IDEA, and how to host the generated documentation using GitHub Pages.

## 📘 What Are JavaDocs?
JavaDocs are automatically-generated documentation pages created from special comment blocks inside Java code.  
They help developers understand how classes, methods, and objects behave.

JavaDoc comments begin with:

```java
/**
 * This is a JavaDoc comment.
 */
```
